Slim version of the Arch package, linux-raspberrypi, for ARM7H (Rasperry PI 2).

This package manages the compilation of the official Raspberry PI 2 kernel
and headers with a custom slimmed down config.v7 configuration file. Does not
support the original Raspberry PI (ARM6 architecture), which uses config.v6,
currently. This should also work on the Raspberry PI 3 (with ARM7 compatability)
but has not been tested.

Note: For experienced users who are willing to manage a custom compiled kernel.


Kernel changes:
Removes support for LVM and MD RAID.
Uses modules instead of compiled in drivers for: BTRFS, XFS, REISERFS, and JFS.


Advantages:
Drastically decreases boot time as a result of no auto-RAID detection.
A few megabytes of free RAM.

Disadvantages:
Advanced usage.
Compile time takes several hours.
Must manually update when new kernel is available.


Arch Dependencies:
git base-devel xmlto docbook-xsl kmod inetutils bc git


Installation:
make
sudo make install

Update the kernel using the same steps as the installation.
